# hamraDownloader
A very basic website downloader in Java

Co-developed with [Deepak Shakya](http://https//in.linkedin.com/pub/deepak-shakya/a/620/404) as an academic project towards completion of 5th Semester during our Bachelor of Computer Applicatons at [SICSR](http://sicsr.ac.in) in 2008.


Note
----
This is a salvaged copy of the project and we no longer maintain it :-)
You should try using [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) which is a better tool!
